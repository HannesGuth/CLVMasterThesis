Currently, there is only one folder where there is everything inside.

A few notes:
- I was not able to calculate the true CLV values, so I simulated some values
- Working document: **"Draft.docx"** (should be changed to latex later, therefore there is no list of references yet)
- Nothing is in a state which I would consider "finished"
- Main purpose at the moment: Present a possible structure with possible contents
- Would be helpful if you could briefly comment on the two methods to create competing intervals and the results table
- **The R files**:
- Everything coded is in there but not cleaned or commented, so no need to look into that too deep/at all
