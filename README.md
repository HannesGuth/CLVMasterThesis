Currently, there is only one folder where there is everything inside.

A few notes:
- I was not able to calculate the true CLV values, so I simulated some values
- Working document: **"Draft.docx"** (should be changed to latex later, therefore there is no list of references yet)
- Nothing is in a state which I would consider "finished"
- Main purpose at the moment: Present a possible structure with possible contents
- Would be helpful if you could briefly comment on the three methods to create competing intervals and the results table (or any other things you like/dislike from the current status)
- **The R files**:
- The methods exist in 3 different files, "Draft Coefficients", "Draft Multplication", and "Draft Conformal prediction averaging"
- The code is not really cleaned yet
- The code from these 3 files is commented in the important parts
